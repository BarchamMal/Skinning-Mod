# The-Skinning-Mod
 This mod allows you to skin creatures instead of getting they're drops directly.
 It also adds alot of byproducts from skinning creatures.

 And as the name implies: It complicates minecraft.

 ##  F.A.Q
  - Q: What is even the use of that?
  - A: Let's say you're running through a cavern farming enemies, now you can carry a stack of each carcase instead of each of their drops individually.

  + Q: How does this effect mob drops?
  + A: Currently, this basically anulls looting and makes it worthless. (You always get 1 carcase, no more or less, and each corpse has the same carcase)
  + A: On the other hand, you also get 32 beef, leather, and ground beef, 2 ribs, 1 tongue, 1 liver, and 12 bones, all from one cow.

  - Q: How does this complicate minecraft?
  - A: You can punch a pig to death, but you can't do anything with the carcase unless you have a sword to skin it with.
  - A: Also, I'm planning (once I add all the carcases) to change some recipes to use the byproducts of skinning.

  + Q: In what way does this modify the *feel* of minecraft
  + A: Well, food for one thing is much easier to get.
  + A: For another thing, things are done a bit more realistic. i.e. you get appropriate amounts of food from animals, bones or bonemeal from animals, byproducts like scutes from turtles or spikes from pufferfish.

 - Q: May I use this mod in my modpack?
 - A: Well, it's not on Curseforge, but if you want to compile it yourself and use it anyways be my guest. Just credit me and provide a link to this repo.

 + Q: Will you port this mod to X version?
 + A: If X is before 1.20.4 then no, I don't plan to.
 + A: If X is after 1.20.4 then yes, when the Fabric APIs are updated.

 - Q: Will you port this mod to Forge?
 - A: No. I don't plan to.

## Contributing

Who doesn't want to help someone make a mod which is purely devoted to complicating minecraft insanely? Hmm?
Well, if you do want to help me (only a crazy person wouldn't) here's how:

### Programmers
You already know how, check the [issues](https://github.com/BarchamMal/Skinning-Mod/issues) or make a [new](https://github.com/BarchamMal/Skinning-Mod/issues/new) one.
Fork the repo, make your changes, make a Pull Request.

### Artists
I'm sure you can find something that looks just off and totaly needs fixed. Same thing.
Fork the repo, make your changes, make a PR, wait for me to say that the new look is not quite what I want, find a halfway compromise, implement it, ask for my review again... rinse and repeat.

### Just creative
I'm sure there is some world building you'd like to modify. Same thing.
Fork the repo, modify the world gen, make a PR.

### Just a player or none of the above
#### Just a player
If you want to report a bug, check the [issues](https://github.com/BarchamMal/Skinning-Mod/issues) to see if it already is there, if not make a [new](https://github.com/BarchamMal/Skinning-Mod/issues/new) one.
#### None of the above
Lang files will always need updated. There are more languages in the world than I'd like to count and each one should have a file for each mod if it can. Same thing.
Fork the repo, add the lang file, make a PR. And I will probably merge it without question because I only know english.
